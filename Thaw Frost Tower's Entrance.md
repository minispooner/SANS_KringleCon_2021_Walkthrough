Talk to Grimy McTrollkins to learn about thawing the Frost Tower entrance.
I'm writing this post after already solving the challenge so I can get specific, but here are the generic steps.
1. Use the WiFi adapter you picked up in the KringleCon Orientation
2. Use the two commands to find the WiFi channel and connect to it
- `WE-SOMETHING-BIN wlan0 scan`
- `SECOND-BIN SOME_FLAGS WIFI_NETWORK_NAME` (no key needed)

# SANS_KringleCon_2021_Walkthrough
I finished the [2021 SANS KingleCon Holiday Hack](http://2021.kringlecon.com)! This repo contains my walkthroughs, hints and answers of the 13 main objectives and most of the side challenges.

## General Approach
When challenge objectives were more of a learning opportunity or lab, my writeups are simply a walkthrough of the lab. However, when recon or exploitation is involved, my writeups are a bit more vague, with hidden hints and answers so you can move at your own pace without spoilers (in most cases).

## Summary
Go to the top floor in Jack's Frost Tower and click on the printer, which sends you to https://printer.kringlecastle.com/.\
Objective: "Investigate the stolen Kringle Castle printer. Get shell access to read the contents of /var/spool/printer.log. What is the name of the last file printed (with a .xlsx extension)? Find Ruby Cyster in Jack's office for help with this objective."

Ruby Cyster tells you to talk to the elf on Santa's Castle's NetWars roof, who tells you to solve the Sleigh challenge behind him, then he'll give you shellcode tips. His tip is pretty useless, but here it is anyways...

Chimney Scissorsticks' Hint:
"Lastly, be careful not to overwrite any register values you need to reference later on in your shellcode."

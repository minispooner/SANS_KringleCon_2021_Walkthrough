## Summary
Go to the top floor in Jack's Frost Tower and click on the printer, which sends you to https://printer.kringlecastle.com/.\
Objective: "Investigate the stolen Kringle Castle printer. Get shell access to read the contents of /var/spool/printer.log. What is the name of the last file printed (with a .xlsx extension)? Find Ruby Cyster in Jack's office for help with this objective."

Ruby Cyster tells you to talk to the elf on Santa's Castle's NetWars roof, who tells you to solve the Sleigh challenge behind him, then he'll give you shellcode tips. His tip is pretty useless, but here it is anyways...

Chimney Scissorsticks' Hint:
"Lastly, be careful not to overwrite any register values you need to reference later on in your shellcode."

Also, the Shellcode Primer challenge is super important, as it preps you for the Printer Exploitation, and when completed, Ruby Oyster gives you some critical hints.

Ruby Oyster's Hint:
Look at the firmware. If you append multiple files of that type, the last one is processed. "Have you heard of Hash Extension Attacks (https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks)?" If something's not working, check the output. The error messages are very verbose.\

## Steps
1. Go to https://printer.kringlecastle.com
2. Click on Firmware Upgrade
3. Click on Download current firmware
4. Read through the JSON and the hash length extension attack writeup
5. Base64 decode the JSON firmware value and look at the binary data. Is there a way to determine what kind of data it is?
6. Hint: Magic numbers and common firmware installs.
7. TODO
8. Convert hash_extender output HEX into Base64 (https://base64.guru/converter/encode/hex)
9. Craft a new firmware.json file using the new base64 string and the new signature (secret length and algorithm remain the same).
10. Upload the new firmware on the Firmware Update page and read the response message for debugging.
11. 





Answer:
1. Create a bash script for a reverse ngrok shell (chmod +x it)
2. Name the file firmware.bin
3. Zip it up
4. Run hash_encoder
5. Make a newfirmware.json file and add contents:
{
"firmware":"B64_ENCODED_RAW_BIN_DATA OUTPUT FROM HASH_EXTENDER",
"signature": "NEW SIGNATURE OUTPUT FROM HASH_EXTENDER",
"secret_length":16,
"algorithm":"SHA256"
}
